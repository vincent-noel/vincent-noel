### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a research scientist in the [Computational Systems Biology of Cancer team](https://institut-curie.org/team/barillot) at Institut Curie, Paris. My main research focus is the modelling of biological systems.

I'm developing multiscale models, which integrate intracellular signalling to simulation of biological tissues. I'm also developing methods to personalize these models and to make them specific to each patient, in order to produce personalized predictions.

I've been the lead developper of [MaBoSS](https://maboss.curie.fr), a continuous time Boolean modelling framework, for more than 5 years. I've been working on **pyMaBoSS**, its python bindings, and I'm developing **cMaBoSS**, it's new python bindings using the Python C API. I also developed [WebMaBoSS](https://maboss.curie.fr/webmaboss/), a web interface for getting started with MaBoSS, **ensembleMaBoSS** to simulate ensembles of Boolean networks, and **PopMaBoSS**, a multicellular pathway modeling framework.

Recently, I've been the lead developper of [PhysiBoSS](https://github.com/physiboss/physiboss), an [PhysiCell](https://physicell.org) addon for integrating intracellular signalling as a Boolean network. I also contributed to **PhysiMeSS**, an addon for modelling fibres, and to [PhysiCell Studio](https://github.com/PhysiCell-Tools/PhysiCell-Studio), the graphical interface for PhysiCell.
