### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a research scientist in the [Computational Systems Biology of Cancer team](https://institut-curie.org/team/barillot) at Institut Curie, Paris. My main research focus is the modelling of biological systems.

I'm developing multiscale models, which integrate intracellular signalling to simulation of biological tissues. I'm also developing methods to personalize these models and to make them specific to each patient, in order to produce personalized predictions.
